            <h2><a name="basics"></a>Basics</h2>

            <p>If you know how to use an RPN calculator (like some
            Hewlett-Packard models), you know how to use rpCalc.  It stores
            previous results in four registers (usually labeled X, Y, Z and T),
            and the numbers are entered before the operators.</p>

            <p>The quickest way to enter numbers and the four basic operators is
            to use the number pad on the keyboard.  For the other keys, the name
            on the key can be typed (not case-sensitive).  What has been typed
            shows in the box below the keys.  The tab key may be used to
            automatically complete a partially typed command.  Of course, the
            mouse may also be used to hit any key.</p>

            <p>A few keys have unusual labels to allow them to be typed:  "RCIP"
            is 1/X, "tn^X" is 10^X, "R&lt;" rolls the stack back (or down),
            "R&gt;" rolls the stack forward (or up), "x&lt;&gt;y" is exchange,
            "CLR" clears the registers, and "&lt;-" is backspace.</p>

            <p>A few commands ("STO", "RCL" and "PLCS") prompt for a number from
            zero through nine.  This number will be the memory register number
            or the number of decimal places for the display.</p>

            <h2><a name="info-win"></a>Information Windows</h2>

            <p>A menu can be displayed by hitting the Esc key or by clicking on
            the main number (LCD) display with the right mouse button.  This
            menu includes commands to display a list of registers, a calculation
            history list, and a memory contents list.  These commands will show
            a new window with the requested information.  The extra window is
            tabbed to toggle between the three lists.  Buttons on the window can
            be used to copy the numbers to the calculator (X-register) or to the
            clipboard (with buttons to copy either all decimal places or the
            formatted fixed decimal place number).</p>

            <p>The register list shows the current contents of each register (X,
            Y, Z and T).  The numbers are shown to full precision, with all
            available decimal places shown.</p>

            <p>The history list shows algebraic equations for every calculation
            that was done in the current rpCalc session.  The numbers are shown
            to the same precision as the main display.</p>

            <p>The memory list shows the current contents of the ten memory
            registers (0-9).  The numbers are shown to the same precision as the
            main display.</p>

            <h2><a name="alt-base"></a>Alternate Bases</h2>

            <p>An alternate base window can be shown from the display context
            menu (right-click the LCD or hit the Esc key).  This window shows
            the hexadecimal, octal and binary equivalents of the number in the
            X-register, rounded to the nearest integer.</p>

            <p>The Hex, Octal, Binary and Decimal buttons are used to change the
            input mode to that base.  There are also keyboard shortcuts (Alt-x,
            Alt-o, Alt-b and Alt-d) that do the same thing.  Any typed number is
            then interpreted using the current base.  The current mode is kept
            until the user changes it.</p>

            <p>Prefixes consisting of a zero followed by the base code (x, o, b
            or d) can be used to temporarily change the input mode.  For
            example, "0x56c" enters the hex number 56c (1388 in decimal).  The
            input mode goes back to decimal after hitting enter or using a
            function.  Note that the alternate base window must be displayed for
            these prefixes to function.</p>

            <p>When using non-decimal input modes, the decimal equivalent of the
            entry is still displayed on the main LCD.  Also, when in hex input
            mode, commands beginning with letters A-F can only be typed if a
            colon (":") is used as a command prefix.</p>

            <p>There is also a Copy Value button that copies the value of the
            current input mode base to the clipboard for use in other
            applications.</p>

            <p>The option dialog has a setting for a limit on the number of
            bits.  Numbers larger than the limit will display "overflow" in the
            alternate base window.  There is also a setting to show negative
            numbers as a two's complement number.</p>

            <h2><a name="option"></a>Options</h2>

            <p>The OPT key will show an options dialog box.  This includes
            settings for startup conditions, display parameters, angle units,
            alternate bases and extra views.</p>

            <p>The startup options include whether to save the register entries
            between sessions and whether to open the extra data or alternate
            base windows when starting rpCalc.</p>

            <p>The display options include several number formatting settings.
            The number of decimal places, use of space as a thousands separator
            and various exponent and engineering notation (exponents divisible
            by three) options can be set.  There are also settings for viewing
            all four RPN registers on the main display and for hiding the LCD
            highlight (clearer for some resolution and window size
            settings).</p>

            <p>The extra views section includes buttons for showing the extra
            data window, the alternate base window, and this readme file.  The
            number of saved equations in the history list can also be set.</p>
