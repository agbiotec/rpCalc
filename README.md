# What is rpCalc?

rpCalc started out as a little program written to try out various Python GUI
toolkits. But I ended up using it all the time (it's much quicker to pull it up
than to pull an actual HP calculator out of the desk), and I made several
improvements. So I decided to make it available to others who also like RPN
calculators.

See the [rpCalc homepage](http://rpcalc.bellz.org) for more info.

There is also an [online version](http://rpcalc.bellz.org/js), written in
JavaScript (see the doug-101/rpCalc-js repository for the source code).
